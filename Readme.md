# EOAS Jupyter project - summer 2020

- Title:  Embedding Open-source Computational Tools into the
  Quantitative Earth Science Specializations

## Getting started

1. Fork this repository

2. Hopefully following [this readme](https://github.com/eoas-ubc/eoas_tlef/blob/master/quantecon-example/README.md) will create a copy of a jupyter book -- file an issue if there's a problem.
